[01:08.76] Intense silence
[01:12.04] As she walked in the room
[01:16.36] Her black robes trailing
[01:20.11] Sister of the moon
[01:24.16] And a black widow spider makes
[01:28.78] More sound than she
[01:33.16] And black moons in those eyes of hers
[01:36.65] Made more sense to me
[01:40.93] Heavy persuasion
[01:46.24] It was hard to breathe
[01:49.50] She was dark at the top of the stairs
[01:52.28] And she called to me
[02:02.28] 
[02:15.24] And so I followed
[02:18.79] As friends often do
[02:22.83] I cared not for love, nor money
[02:27.38] I think she knew
[02:31.01] Well, the people they still love her
[02:34.97] And still they are the most cruel
[02:39.25] She asked me
[02:41.06] Be my sister, sister, sister of the moon
[03:01.06] 
[03:22.32] Some call her sister of the moon
[03:25.85] Some say illusions are her game
[03:32.93] They like to wrap her in velvet
[03:37.22] Does anyone, ooo... know her name
