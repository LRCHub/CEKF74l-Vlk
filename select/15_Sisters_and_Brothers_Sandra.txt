Count on my kisses
And children at play
Do you remember
It's so far away
Give us back to the truth
'Cause divided we fall

Sisters and brothers are growing so tall
Strangers and lovers make fools of us all

Where is the laughter
That ends with our pain
Where are the summers
Without any rain
Can there ever return
All the years I recall

Sisters and brothers are growing so tall
Strangers and lovers make fools of us all

If you can hear me, I need you right now

Sisters and brothers are growing so tall
Strangers and lovers make fools of us all
