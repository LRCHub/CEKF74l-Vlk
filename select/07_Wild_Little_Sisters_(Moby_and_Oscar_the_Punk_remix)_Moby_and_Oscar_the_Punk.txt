Somewhere beyond the sea
Somewhere waitin' for me
My lover stands on golden sands and watches the ships
That go sailin'
Somewhere beyond the sea
She's there watchin' for me
If I could fly like birds on high then straight to her arms
I'd go sailin'
It's far beyond a star
It's near beyond the moon
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea and never again
I'll go sailin'
I know beyond a doubt
My heart will lead me there soon
We'll meet I know we'll meet beyond the shore
We'll kiss just as before
Happy we'll be beyond the sea and never again
I'll go sailin'
No more sailin'
So long sailin'
Bye bye sailin'
