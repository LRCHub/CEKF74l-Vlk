There were two sisters side by side
Sing aye dumb, sing aye day
There were two sisters side by side
The boys are born for me
There were two sisters side by side
The eldest for young johnny cried
I'll be true for my love
If he'll be true to me
Johnny bought the youngest a gay gold ring,
He never bought the eldest a single thing
Johnny bought the youngest a beaver hat,
The eldest never thought much of that
As they were walking by the foamy brim,
The eldest pushed the youngest in
Sister, oh sister give me thy hand,
And you can have johnny and all his land
Sister i won't give you my hand,
And i'll have johnny and all his land
So there she sank and away she swam,
Until she came to the miller's dam
Miller took away her gay gold ring,
And then he pushed her in again
Miller he was hanged on the mountain head,
The eldest sister was boiled in lead
